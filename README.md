# SuperMarioBros
 A Super Mario Bros Clone

Following are some of the bugs -
1. Mario is a bit bouncy on movement on ground
2. Stomping a Goomba not working
3. Able to collect coins from mystery boxes from standing above also
4. Live score and coins is not updating
5. Goomba not flipping upon collision
6. In camera movement mario is able to move to the left of the camera

I was also not able to implement any sort of animation on mario, but was able to implement the animation on goomba.

Following mechanics are working in the game -
1. Mario - Movement - Left, Right, Jump
2. Enemy - Automatically Moves Left, Enemy entities only activate upon screen visible. Upon collision game restarts detecting 1 life
3. Coin Collection - Coin and Score is incremented upon mystery box collection
4. Dead Zone - Game restarts when Mario falls in the pit
5. Camera Movement - Camera is moving towards the right along with Mario
6. Upon entering the castle game overs
7. Upon Game Over - After 5 secs the game restarts
8. Game Manager - Game Start, Game Over, Add Coin, Add Score etc
9. UI Manager - Score, Coins, and Lives are shown
10. Audio - Basic Music played in background, Mystery Box collection sound
