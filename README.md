# Super Mario Bros
An attempt to clone the infamous Super Mario Bros

You can download the playable build from - https://visheshshahani.itch.io/super-mario-bros-clone

## The following mechanics are working in the game -
**1. Mario** - Movement - Left, Right, Jump

**2. Enemy** - Automatically Moves Left, Enemy entities only activate upon screen visible. Upon collision game restarts detecting 1 life

**3. Coin Collection** - Coin and Score is incremented upon the mystery box collection

**4. Dead Zone** - The game restarts when Mario falls in the pit

**5. Camera Movement** - The camera is moving towards the right along with Mario

**6. Castle** - Upon entering the castle game overs

**7. Upon Game Over** - After 5 seconds the game restarts

**8. Game Manager** - Game Start, Game Over, Add Coin, Add Score etc

**9. UI Manager** - Score, Coins, and Lives are shown

**10. Audio** - Basic Music played in the background, Mystery Box collection sound

### I was also not able to implement any animation on Mario but I was able to implement the animation on goomba.

## Following are some of the bugs -
1. Stomping a Goomba not working
2. Live score and coins are not updating
3. Goomba not flipping upon collision
4. In the camera movement Mario can move to the left of the camera
